## Project Details 
The highlight of this software is to facilitate the management of an orphanage. Our primary focus is on allowing the administration to efficiently manage the organization. An overview of all the departments and their respective details, such as inventory management or employee status are just a few clicks away. There is also a funds management system in place to keep track of transactions and balance, as well as features to manage the staff.
	The system also comprises an interface for external users of the system such as the donors, volunteers, and potential parents looking to adopt or the general population interested in knowing more about the services the orphanage offers to the children under its care.
The web portal for donors allows them to make donations via a secure channel for payment. Sensitive donor data is stored in encrypted form. Donor details are automatically saved to the database for the administration as they are a key to the orphanage’s future growth and sustainability by allowing the administration to better understand the donor community, thereby enabling admin to target new prospects more efficiently.
Volunteers can view departments available inside the orphanage where they wish to work before submitting an online request.
Prospective employees can apply in various departments by booking an appointment and submitting an employment application form.  
Potential parents can sign up and fill out an adoption application on the portal. Application details are then saved by the system, analyzed by a program that evaluates and rates the application before making the result available for the admin to proceed further.
